        "Introducing React Hooks"</a>, also by Traversy
        Media, was helpful as well. <br /> <br />

    'http://www.clker.com/clipart-round-white-clock.html'
        rel='noreferrer noopener' target='_blank'> a site
        that offers free clipart</a>; I give my thanks
        to them.
        <br /> <br /> Hope you find this application
        useful. Thanks for checking this out! </p>
