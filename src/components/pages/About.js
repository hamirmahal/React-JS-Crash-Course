        <p> This is a Todo list application Hamir created
        with the help of Traversy Media's React JS Crash
        Course, which you can view by clicking <a href=

        rel='noreferrer noopener' target='_blank'>here</a>.
        <br /> <br /> To assist with avoiding the use of
        class-based components, and using mostly
        stateful functional components, I also watched
        "Introducing React Hooks", also by Traversy Media,
        which you can view <a href=

        <br /> <br /> Hope you find this application
        useful. Thanks for checking this out! </p>
